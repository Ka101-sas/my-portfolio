        Hello, I'm Kavya Saraswat, an aspiring professional currently completing my education at Amrapali Group of Institutes, set to graduate in 2024. I laid the foundation for my academic journey at Kendriya Vidyalaya Haridwar.

      <p class="about-me-text">
        My technical prowess includes proficiency in programming languages such as C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a solid grasp of database query language SQL and utilize Tableau for data visualization, reflecting my commitment to staying at the forefront of technology.

In terms of professional experience, I've delved into content creation through an internship at Pinkieshe Foundation, showcasing my writing abilities. Additionally, I've gained valuable technical experience as a Data Analytics Trainee at MedTourEasy, where I've honed my analytical skills.

      <p class="about-me-text">
        Outside the realm of academia and technology, I am a passionate blogger, sharing my thoughts and insights on Medium. On a different note, I have immersed myself in the world of classical dance, specifically Kathak, dedicating three years to its study. This dual passion for technology and the arts reflects my unique blend of creativity and intelligence.
        I am excited about the prospect of applying my diverse skill set to new challenges and making meaningful contributions wherever my journey takes me.
